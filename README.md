##### Intro
Greetings!  
My name is Shane and I am one of the creators of Epic Fail Inc, a website that was created for our entry to this competition.  
  
We decided to create "Boom" as our first ever public Unity game for the Github Game-off because we felt like it would give us the incentive
and motivation required to actually start and finish a game. Unfortunately, however, this game was a victim of procrastination.  
  
##### Theme  
The rules state the game must meet certain themes, this game meets "merging". You may merge bombs together to make more powerful explosions, though with my current levels this is not necessary.  
  
##### Description
Boom is a side-scrolling puzzle game that involves strategically placing bombs in order to destroy or move obstacles that block you from reaching
your objective.  
 
Game:
