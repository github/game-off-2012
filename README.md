Here at GitHub, we're no strangers to hosting or sponsoring hackathons. With the growing number of games and game development resources on GitHub, we thought it was about time to throw our very own game jam!

## The Challenge

You have the entire month of November to create a **web-based** game loosely built around one or more of the following:

* forking (or forks)
* branching (or branches)
* cloning (or clones)
* pushing
* pulling

**Please note:** an additional secret theme will be announced Nov 1st! Please tweet your suggestions mentioning #ggo12 and we'll pick the best!

What do we mean by **loosely** based on these concepts? We literally mean, *loosely* based. Some examples might be

* a FPS where you throw forks at water balloons
* a RPG where you walk about pushing people
* an educational game about DNA cloning
* a text adventure about monkeys swinging from branches
* a platformer where you push and pull objects

Your game. Your rules. You can participate as an individual or as a team.

## Prizes

We'll have a number of categories e.g. Best Use of Open Source, Best Student Project, etc. Winners of each category will win shiny new iPads with Retina displays (64GB wifi models), or if you'd prefer an iPad mini or money towards a Macbook Pro, we'll give you Apple Store Credit for the value of the iPad. Runners up will receive a package of GitHub swag.

If you have a team submission, we'll give you Apple Store credit equal to the value of the iPad. You can split it with your teammates as appropriate.
