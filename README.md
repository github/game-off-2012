## Description

Help Hotfix collect stargazers and avoid enemies. Collect commits to upgrade hotfix and add new features.

## Controls

Click or press space to jump. The longer you hold, the longer the jump (there is a upper threshold of course).

Jumping watchers can be destroyed by jumping on them. If you do so, you will be able to double jump.

By collecting commits, add new features to hotfix. The more features you have, the more likely you will progress in the game.

Poisonned forks appear on the branches at the beginning of the game. If you touch them, you are dead.

### Round forks

Round forks appear often between branches. If you touch them, you are dead.

### Jumping watchers

![alt text](http://sdrdis.github.com/hotfix/images/jumping-watchers.png "Jumping watchers")

Once upon a time, in the World Wide Web gitdom, there were watchers. They were replaced by stargazers so now they seek revenge.

You are dead if you touch them, unless you jump on them. If you do so, you will be able to double jump.

### Forker watchers

They are an evolved form of watchers: they throw forks. The forks are poisonned, so you die if you touch them.
