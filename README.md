As a little bud, Venus always wished for conquering the enormous tower that always stood above her. One day, she decided to climb it and grow beyond any other plant can imagen. Help her in her quest!

##  How To Play?

*Click on a Venus head in order to project a possible branch. Release the button over the same head so she can branch into two more heads. Release the button anywhere else to cancel the action.

*Click and drag anywhere else in order to rotate the camera around the tower, so you can see all of Venus heads.

*Plan carefully how she will branch: There are a lot of wood beams and windows that can stop her.

*Eat butterflies so Venus can grow. She can grow only 5 times. The more she grows, the stronger her branchs will be; plus she will be able to withstand more hits against wood beams!

## Open Source Projects Used:

* [Starling Framework](http://gamua.com/starling/), an Open Source Game Engine for Flash.

Also, coding this was much easier thanks to the [Code for Translating Away3D 3D point to a 2D point in Starling framework](http://www.mycreativity.nl/blog/translating-away3d-3d-point-to-a-2d-point-in-starling-framework) by Jasper Steenweg.
