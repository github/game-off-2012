/**
 * Most easing equations give a smooth, gradual transition between the start and end values, but RoughEase provides
 * an easy way to get a rough, jagged effect instead. You can define an ease that it will use as a template (like a
 * general guide - Linear.easeNone is the default) and then it will randomly plot points that wander from that template. 
 * The strength parameter controls how far from the template ease the points are allowed to go (a small number like
 * 0.1 keeps it very close to the template ease whereas a larger number like 2 creates much larger jumps). You can
 * also control the number of points in the ease, making it jerk more or less frequently. And lastly, you can associate
 * a name with each RoughEase instance and retrieve it later like RoughEase.byName("myEaseName"). Since creating 
 * the initial RoughEase is the most processor-intensive part, it's a good idea to reuse instances if/when you can.<br /><br />
 * 
 * <b>EXAMPLE CODE</b><br /><br /><code>
 * import com.greensock.TweenLite;<br />
 * import com.greensock.easing.RoughEase;<br /><br />
 * 
 * TweenLite.from(mc, 3, {alpha:0, ease:RoughEase.create(1, 15)});<br /><br />
 * 
 * //or create an instance directly<br />
 * var rough:RoughEase = new RoughEase(1.5, 30, true, Strong.easeOut, "none", true, "superRoughEase");<br />
 * TweenLite.to(mc, 3, {y:300, ease:rough.ease});<br /><br />
 * 
 * //and later, you can find the ease by name like:<br />
 * TweenLite.to(mc, 3, {y:300, ease:RoughEase.byName("superRoughEase")});
 * </code><br /><br />

		 * 
		 * @param strength amount of variance from the templateEase (Linear.easeNone by default) that each random point can be placed. A low number like 0.1 will hug very closely to the templateEase whereas a larger number like 2 will allow the values to wander further away from the templateEase.
		 * @param points quantity of random points to plot in the ease. A larger number will cause more (and quicker) flickering.
		 * @param restrictMaxAndMin If true, the ease will prevent random points from exceeding the end value or dropping below the starting value. For example, if you're tweening the x property from 0 to 100, the RoughEase would force all random points to stay between 0 and 100 if restrictMaxAndMin is true, but if it is false, a x could potentially jump above 100 or below 0 at some point during the tween (it would always end at 100 though).
		 * @param templateEase an easing equation that should be used as a template or guide. Then random points are plotted at a certain distance away from the templateEase (based on the strength parameter). The default is Linear.easeNone.
		 * @param taper to make the strength of the roughness taper towards the end or beginning or both, use "out", "in", or "both" respectively here (default is "none").
		 * @param randomize to randomize the placement of the points, set randomize to true (otherwise the points will zig-zag evenly across the ease)
		 * @param name a name to associate with the ease so that you can use RoughEase.byName() to look it up later. Of course you should always make sure you use a unique name for each ease (if you leave it blank, a name will automatically be generated).
