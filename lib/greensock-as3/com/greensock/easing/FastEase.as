/**
 * TweenMax (AS3 only) has built-in algorithms that speed up the processing of certain easing equations but in order
 * to take advantage of those optimizations, you must activate the easing equations first (you only need to
 * activate them ONCE in your swf). The following easing equations from the com.greensock.easing package are 
 * eligible for activation:
 * <code>
 * <ul>
 *     	<li>Linear (easeIn, easeOut, easeInOut, and easeNone)</li>
 * 		<li>Quad (easeIn, easeOut, and easeInOut)</li>
 * 		<li>Cubic (easeIn, easeOut, and easeInOut)</li>
 * 		<li>Quart (easeIn, easeOut, and easeInOut)</li>
 * 		<li>Quint (easeIn, easeOut, and easeInOut)</li>
 * 		<li>Strong (easeIn, easeOut, and easeInOut)</li>
 * </ul><br />
 * </code>
 * 
 * <b>EXAMPLE</b><br /><br />
 * 
 * <code>
 * 		import com.greensock.easing.*;<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//activate the optimized ease classes<br />
 * 		FastEase.activate([Strong, Linear, Quad]);<br /><br />
 * 
 * 		//then tween as usual (you don't have to do anything special in your tweens)<br />
 * 		TweenMax.to(mc, 2, {x:200, ease:Linear.easeNone});<br /><br />
 * </code>
 * 
 * Once activated, the easing calculations run about <b>35-80% faster!</b> Keep in mind that the easing calculations are only one small part
 * of the tweening engine, so you may only see a 2-15% improvement overall depending on the equation and quantity of simultaneous tweens.
 * 
 * Notes: <br />
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>TweenLite does <b>NOT</b> have the internal algorithms in place to take advantage of optimized eases at this time (to conserve file size).</li>
 * 		<li>Activating an ease multiple times doesn't hurt or help</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @param easeClasses An Array containing the easing classes to activate, like [Strong, Linear, Quad]. It will automatically activate the easeIn, easeOut, easeInOut, and (if available) easeNone easing equations for each class in the Array.

		 * @param type The type of ease (in, out, or inOut) where easeIn is 1, easeOut is 2, and easeInOut is 3.
		 * @param power The magnitude or power of the ease. For example, Linear is 0, Quad is 1, Cubic is 2, Quart is 3 and Quint and Strong are 4.
