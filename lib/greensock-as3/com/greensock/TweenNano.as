/**
 * 	TweenNano is a super-lightweight (1.6k in AS3 and 2k in AS2) version of <a href="http://www.TweenLite.com">TweenLite</a> 
 *  and is only recommended for situations where you absolutely cannot afford the extra 3.1k (4.7k total) that the normal 
 *  TweenLite engine would cost and your project doesn't require any plugins. Normally, it is much better to use 
 *  TweenLite because of the additional flexibility it provides via plugins and its compatibility with TimelineLite and TimelineMax. 
 *  TweenNano can do everything TweenLite can do with the following exceptions:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li><b> No Plugins </b>- One of the great things about TweenLite is that you can activate
 * 			plugins in order to add features (like autoAlpha, tint, blurFilter, etc.). TweenNano, however, 
 * 			doesn't work with plugins. </li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li><b> Incompatible with TimelineLite and TimelineMax </b>- Complex sequencing and management of groups of 
 * 			tweens can be much easier with TimelineLite and TimelineMax, but TweenNano instances cannot be inserted into
 * 			TimelineLite or TimelineMax instances.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li><b> Slight speed decrease </b>- Under very heavy loads, TweenNano won't perform quite as well as TweenLite, but
 * 			it is extremely unlikely that you'd notice unless you're tweening thousands of objects simultaneously.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li><b> Fewer overwrite modes </b>- You can either overwrite all or none of the existing tweens of the same 
 * 			object (overwrite:true or overwrite:false) in TweenNano. TweenLite, however, can use OverwriteManager to expand 
 * 			its capabilities and use modes like AUTO, CONCURRENT, PREEXISTING, and ALL_ONSTART
 * 			(see <a href="http://www.greensock.com/overwritemanager/">http://www.greensock.com/overwritemanager/</a>
 * 			for details).</li>
 * 
 * 		<li><b>Compared to TweenLite, TweenNano is missing the following methods/properties:</b>
 * 			<ul>
 * 				<li>pause()</li>
 * 				<li>play()</li>
 * 				<li>resume()</li>
 * 				<li>restart()</li>
 * 				<li>reverse()</li>
 * 				<li>invalidate()</li>
 * 				<li>onStart</li>
 * 				<li>onInit</li>
 * 				<li>defaultEase</li>
 * 				<li>easeParams</li>
 * 				<li>currentTime</li>
 * 				<li>startTime</li>
 * 				<li>totalTime</li>
 * 				<li>paused</li>
 * 				<li>reversed</li>
 * 				<li>totalDuration</li>
 * 			</ul>
 * 		</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 
 * <hr/>	
 * <b>SPECIAL PROPERTIES:</b>
 * <br /><br />
 * 
 * Any of the following special properties can optionally be passed in through the vars object (the third parameter):
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><b> delay : Number</b>			Amount of delay in seconds (or frames for frames-based tweens) before the tween should begin.</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> useFrames : Boolean</b>		If useFrames is set to true, the tweens's timing mode will be based on frames. 
 * 										Otherwise, it will be based on seconds/time.</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> ease : Function</b>			Use any standard easing equation to control the rate of change. For example, 
 * 										<code>Elastic.easeOut</code>. The Default is Regular.easeOut.</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onUpdate : Function</b>		A function that should be called every time the tween's time/position is updated 
 * 										(on every frame while the timeline is active)</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onUpdateParams : Array</b>	An Array of parameters to pass the onUpdate function</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onComplete : Function</b>	A function that should be called when the tween has finished </li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onCompleteParams : Array</b> An Array of parameters to pass the onComplete function.</li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> immediateRender : Boolean</b> Normally when you create a from() tween, it renders the starting state immediately even
 * 										  if you define a delay which in typical "animate in" scenarios is very desirable, but
 * 										  if you prefer to override this behavior and have the from() tween render only after any 
 * 										  delay has elapsed, set <code>immediateRender</code> to false. </li>
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> overwrite : Boolean</b>		Controls how other tweens of the same object are handled when this tween is created. Here are the options:
 * 										<ul>
 * 			  							<li><b> false (NONE):</b> No tweens are overwritten. This is the fastest mode, but you need to be careful not 
 * 													to create any tweens with overlapping properties of the same object that run at the same time, 
 * 													otherwise they'll conflict with each other. <br /><code>
 * 												   		TweenNano.to(mc, 1, {x:100, y:200});<br />
 * 														TweenNano.to(mc, 1, {x:300, delay:2, overwrite:false}); //does NOT overwrite the previous tween.</code></li>
 * 											
 * 										<li><b> true (ALL_IMMEDIATE):</b> This is the default mode in TweenNano. All tweens of the same target
 * 													are completely overwritten immediately when the tween is created, regardless of whether or 
 * 													not any of the properties overlap. <br /><code>
 * 												   		TweenNano.to(mc, 1, {x:100, y:200});<br />
 * 														TweenNano.to(mc, 1, {x:300, delay:2, overwrite:true}); //immediately overwrites the previous tween</code></li>
 * 										</ul></li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 
 * <b>EXAMPLES:</b> <br /><br />
 * 
 * 	Tween the the MovieClip "mc" to an alpha value of 0.5 (50% transparent) and an x-coordinate of 120 
 * 	over the course of 1.5 seconds like so:<br /><br />
 * 	
 * <code>
 * 		import com.greensock.TweenNano;<br /><br />
 * 		TweenNano.to(mc, 1.5, {alpha:0.5, x:120});
 * 	</code><br /><br />
 *  
 * 	To tween the "mc" MovieClip's alpha property to 0.5, its x property to 120 using the <code>Back.easeOut</code> easing 
 *  function, delay starting the whole tween by 2 seconds, and then call a function named "onFinishTween" when it 
 *  has completed (it will have a duration of 5 seconds) and pass a few parameters to that function (a value of 
 *  5 and a reference to the mc), you'd do so like:<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 	<code>
 * 		import com.greensock.TweenNano;<br />
 * 		import com.greensock.easing.Back;<br /><br />
 * 
 * 		TweenNano.to(mc, 5, {alpha:0.5, x:120, ease:Back.easeOut, delay:2, onComplete:onFinishTween, onCompleteParams:[5, mc]});<br />
 * 		function onFinishTween(param1:Number, param2:MovieClip):void {<br />
 * 			trace("The tween has finished! param1 = " + param1 + ", and param2 = " + param2);<br />
 * 		}
 * 	</code><br /><br />
 *  
 * 	If you have a MovieClip on the stage that is already in it's end position and you just want to animate it into 
 * 	place over 5 seconds (drop it into place by changing its y property to 100 pixels higher on the screen and 
 * 	dropping it from there), you could:<br /><br />
 * 	
 *  <code>
 * 		import com.greensock.TweenNano;<br />
 * 		import com.greensock.easing.Elastic;<br /><br />
 * 
 * 		TweenNano.from(mc, 5, {y:"-100", ease:Elastic.easeOut});		
 *  </code><br /><br />
 * 
 * <b>NOTES:</b><br /><br />
 * <ul>
 * 	<li> The base TweenNano class adds about 1.6k to your Flash file.</li>
 * 	  
 * 	<li> Passing values as Strings will make the tween relative to the current value. For example, if you do
 * 	  <code>TweenNano.to(mc, 2, {x:"-20"});</code> it'll move the mc.x to the left 20 pixels which is the same as doing
 * 	  <code>TweenNano.to(mc, 2, {x:mc.x - 20});</code> You could also cast it like: <code>TweenNano.to(mc, 2, {x:String(myVariable)});</code></li>
 * 	
 * 	<li> Kill all tweens for a particular object anytime with the <code>TweenNano.killTweensOf(mc); </code></li>
 * 	  
 * 	<li> You can kill all delayedCalls to a particular function using <code>TweenNano.killTweensOf(myFunction);</code>
 * 	  This can be helpful if you want to preempt a call.</li>
 * 
 *  <li> If some of your tweens don't appear to be working, read about the <code>overwrite</code> special property
 * 		above - it is most likely an overwriting issue that could be solved by adding <code>overwrite:false</code> to your vars object.</li>
 * 	  
 * 	<li> Use the <code>TweenNano.from()</code> method to animate things into place. For example, if you have things set up on 
 * 	  the stage in the spot where they should end up, and you just want to animate them into place, you can 
 * 	  pass in the beginning x and/or y and/or alpha (or whatever properties you want).</li>
 * 	  
 * 	<li> If you find this class useful, please consider joining Club GreenSock which not only helps to sustain
 * 	  ongoing development, but also gets you bonus plugins, classes and other benefits that are ONLY available 
 * 	  to members. Learn more at <a href="http://www.greensock.com/club/">http://www.greensock.com/club/</a></li>
