/**
 * OverwriteManager resolves conflicts between tweens and controls if (and how) existing tweens of the same
 * target are overwritten. Think of it as a referee or traffic cop for tweens. For example, let's say you have
 * a button with <code>ROLL_OVER</code> and <code>ROLL_OUT</code> handlers that tween an object's alpha and the user rolls their mouse
 * over/out/over/out quickly. Most likely, you'd want each new tween to overwrite the other immediately so
 * that you don't end up with multiple tweens vying for control of the alpha property. That describes
 * the <code>ALL_IMMEDIATE</code> mode which is the default mode of TweenLite when it is not used in conjunction with
 * TweenMax, TimelineLite, or TimelineMax. This keeps things small and fast. However, it isn't ideal for 
 * setting up sequences because as soon as you create subsequent tweens of the same target in the sequence, 
 * the previous one gets overwritten. And what if you have a tween that is controling 3 properties and 
 * then you create another tween that only controls one of those properties? You may want the first tween 
 * to continue tweening the other 2 (non-overlapping) properties. This describes the <code>AUTO</code> mode which is 
 * the default whenever TweenMax, TimelineLite, or TimelineMax is used in your swf. OverwriteManager
 * offers quite a few other modes to choose from in fact:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 		<li><b> NONE (0):</b> 
 * 					<ol>
 * 						<li><b>When:</b> Never</li>
 * 						<li><b>Finds:</b> Nothing</li>
 * 						<li><b>Kills:</b> Nothing</li>
 * 						<li><b>Performance:</b> Excellent</li>
 * 						<li><b>Good for:</b> When you know that your tweens won't conflict and you want maximum speed.</li>
 * 					</ol>
 * 		</li>
 * 				
 * 		<li><b> ALL_IMMEDIATE (1):</b> 
 * 					<ol>
 * 						<li><b>When:</b> Immediately when the tween is created.</li>
 * 						<li><b>Finds:</b> All tweens of the same target (regardless of timing or overlapping properties).</li>
 * 						<li><b>Kills:</b> Every tween found</li>
 * 						<li><b>Performance:</b> Excellent</li>
 * 						<li><b>Good for:</b> When you want the tween to take priority over all other tweens of the 
 * 											 same target, like on button rollovers/rollouts. However, this mode is 
 * 											 bad for setting up sequences.</li>
 * 					</ol>
 * 					This is the default mode for TweenLite unless TweenMax, TimelineLite, 
 * 					or TimelineMax are used in the SWF (in which case <code>AUTO</code> is the default mode).
 * 		</li>
 * 					
 * 		<li><b> AUTO (2):</b> 
 * 					<ol>
 * 						<li><b>When:</b> The first time the tween renders (you can <code>invalidate()</code> a tween to force it 
 * 										 to re-init and run its overwriting routine again next time it renders)</li>
 * 						<li><b>Finds:</b> Only tweens of the same target that are active (running). Tweens that haven't started yet are immune.</li>
 * 						<li><b>Kills:</b> Only individual overlapping tweening properties. If all tweening properties 
 * 										  have been overwritten, the entire tween will be killed as well.</li>
 * 						<li><b>Performance:</b> Very good when there aren't many overlapping tweens; fair when there are.</li>
 * 						<li><b>Good for:</b> Virtually all situations. This mode does the best job overall of handling 
 * 											 overwriting in an intuitive way and is excellent for sequencing. </li>
 * 					</ol>
 * 					This is the default mode when TweenMax, TimelineLite, or TimelineMax is used in your swf (those classes
 * 					automatically init() OverwriteManager in <code>AUTO</code> mode unless you have already initted OverwriteManager manually).
 * 		</li>
 * 					
 * 		<li><b> CONCURRENT (3):</b> 
 * 					<ol>
 * 						<li><b>When:</b> The first time the tween renders (you can <code>invalidate()</code> a tween to force it 
 * 										 to re-init and run its overwriting routine again next time it renders)</li>
 * 						<li><b>Finds:</b> Only tweens of the same target that are active (running). Tweens that haven't started yet are immune.</li>
 * 						<li><b>Kills:</b> Every tween found</li>
 * 						<li><b>Performance:</b> Very good</li>
 * 						<li><b>Good for:</b> When you want the target object to only be controled by one tween at a time. Good
 * 											 for sequencing although AUTO mode is typically better because it will only kill
 * 											 individual overlapping properties instead of entire tweens.</li>
 * 					</ol>
 * 		</li>
 * 				
 * 		<li><b> ALL_ONSTART (4):</b> 
 * 					<ol>
 * 						<li><b>When:</b> The first time the tween renders (you can <code>invalidate()</code> a tween to force it 
 * 										 to re-init and run its overwriting routine again next time it renders)</li>
 * 						<li><b>Finds:</b> All tweens of the same target (regardless of timing or overlapping properties).</li>
 * 						<li><b>Kills:</b> Every tween found</li>
 * 						<li><b>Performance:</b> Very good</li>
 * 						<li><b>Good for:</b> When you want a tween to take priority and wipe out all other tweens of the 
 * 											 same target even if they start later. This mode is rarely used.</li>
 * 					</ol>
 * 		</li>
 * 
 * 		<li><b> PREEXISTING (5):</b> 
 * 					<ol>
 * 						<li><b>When:</b> The first time the tween renders (you can <code>invalidate()</code> a tween to force it 
 * 										 to re-init and run its overwriting routine again next time it renders)</li>
 * 						<li><b>Finds:</b> Only the tweens of the same target that were created before this tween was created 
 * 										  (regardless of timing or overlapping properties). Virtually identical to <code>ALL_IMMEDIATE</code>
 * 										  except that <code>PREEXISTING</code> doesn't run its overwriting routines until it renders for the
 * 										  first time, meaning that if it has a delay, other tweens won't be overwritten until the delay expires.</li>
 * 						<li><b>Kills:</b> Every tween found</li>
 * 						<li><b>Performance:</b> Very good</li>
 * 						<li><b>Good for:</b> When the order in which your code runs plays a critical role, like when tweens
 * 											 that you create later should always take precidence over previously created ones
 * 											 regardless of when they're scheduled to run. If <code>ALL_IMMEDIATE</code> is great except
 * 											 that you want to wait on overwriting until the tween begins, <code>PREEXISTING</code> is perfect.</li>
 * 					</ol>
 * 		</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 
 * With the exception of <code>ALL_IMMEDIATE</code> (which performs overwriting immediatly when the tween is created), 
 * all overwriting occurs when a tween renders for the first time. So if your tween has a delay of 1 second,
 * it will not overwrite any tweens until that point. <br /><br />
 * 
 * You can define a default overwriting mode for all tweens using the <code>OverwriteManager.init()</code> method, like:<br /><br /><code>
 * 
 * 		OverwriteManager.init(OverwriteManager.AUTO);<br /><br /></code>
 * 
 * If you want to override the default mode in a particular tween, just use the <code>overwrite</code> special 
 * property. You can use the static constant or the corresponding number. The following two lines produce 
 * the same results:<br /><br /><code>
 * 
 * 		TweenMax.to(mc, 1, {x:100, overwrite:OverwriteManager.PREXISTING});<br />
 * 		TweenMax.to(mc, 1, {x:100, overwrite:5});<br /><br /></code>
 * 
 * OverwriteManager is a separate, optional class for TweenLite primarily because of file size concerns. 
 * Without initting OverwriteManager, TweenLite can only recognize modes 0 and 1 (<code>NONE</code> and <code>ALL_IMMEDIATE</code>). 
 * However, TweenMax, TimelineLite, and TimelineMax automatically init() OverwriteManager in <code>AUTO</code> mode 
 * unless you have already initted OverwriteManager manually. You do not need to take any additional steps
 * to use AUTO mode if you're using any of those classes somewhere in your project. Keep in mind too that setting 
 * the default OverwriteManager mode will affect TweenLite and TweenMax tweens.<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 
 * <b>EXAMPLES:</b><br /><br /> 
 * 
 * 	To start OverwriteManager in <code>AUTO</code> mode (the default) and then do a simple TweenLite tween, simply do:<br /><br /><code>
 * 		
 * 		import com.greensock.OverwriteManager;<br />
 * 		import com.greensock.TweenLite;<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		OverwriteManager.init(OverwriteManager.AUTO);<br />
 * 		TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {x:300});<br /><br /></code>
 * 		
 * 	You can also define overwrite behavior in individual tweens, like so:<br /><br /><code>
 * 	
 * 		import com.greensock.OverwriteManager;<br />
 * 		import com.greensock.TweenLite;<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		OverwriteManager.init(2);<br />
 * 		TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {x:"300", y:"100"});<br />
 * 		TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {alpha:0.5, overwrite:1}); //or use the constant OverwriteManager.ALL_IMMEDIATE<br />
 * 		TweenLite.to(mc, 3, {x:200, rotation:30, overwrite:2}); //or use the constant OverwriteManager.AUTO<br /><br /></code>
 * 		
 * 		
 * 	OverwriteManager's mode can be changed anytime after init() is called, like.<br /><br /><code>
 * 		
 * 		OverwriteManager.mode = OverwriteManager.CONCURRENT;<br /><br /></code>
