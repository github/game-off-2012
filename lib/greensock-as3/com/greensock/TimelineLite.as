/**
 * 	TimelineLite is a lightweight, intuitive timeline class for building and managing sequences of 
 * 	TweenLite, TweenMax, TimelineLite, and/or TimelineMax instances. You can think of a TimelineLite instance 
 *  like a virtual MovieClip timeline or a container where you place tweens (or other timelines) over the 
 *  course of time. You can:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li> build sequences easily by adding tweens with the append(), prepend(), insert(), appendMultiple(), prependMultiple(),
 * 			and insertMultiple() methods. Tweens can overlap as much as you want and you have complete control over where 
 * 			they get placed on the timeline.</li>
 * 
 * 		<li> add labels, play(), stop(), gotoAndPlay(), gotoAndStop(), restart(), and even reverse() smoothly anytime. </li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> nest timelines within timelines as deeply as you want.</li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> set the progress of the timeline using its <code>currentProgress</code> property. For example, to skip to
 * 		  the halfway point, set <code>myTimeline.currentProgress = 0.5</code>. </li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> tween the <code>currentTime</code> or <code>currentProgress</code> property to fastforward/rewind 
 * 			the timeline. You could even attach a slider to one of these properties to give the user the ability 
 * 			to drag forwards/backwards through the timeline.</li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> speed up or slow down the entire timeline with its timeScale property. You can even tween
 * 		  this property to gradually speed up or slow down.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> add onComplete, onStart, onUpdate, and/or onReverseComplete callbacks using the constructor's <code>vars</code> object.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> use the <code>insertMultiple()</code> or <code>appendMultiple()</code> methods to create complex sequences including 
 * 			various alignment modes and staggering capabilities.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> base the timing on frames instead of seconds if you prefer. Please note, however, that
 * 		  the timeline's timing mode dictates its childrens' timing mode as well. </li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> kill the tweens of a particular object with <code>killTweensOf()</code> or get the tweens of an object
 * 		  with <code>getTweensOf()</code> or get all the tweens/timelines in the timeline with <code>getChildren()</code></li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> If you need even more features like AS3 event listeners, <code>repeat, repeatDelay, yoyo, currentLabel, 
 * 			getLabelAfter(), getLabelBefore(), addCallback(), removeCallback(), getActive()</code> and more, check out 
 * 			TimelineMax which extends TimelineLite.</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 	
 * <b>EXAMPLE:</b><br /><br /><code>
 * 	
 * 		import com.greensock.~~;<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//create the timeline and add an onComplete callback that will call myFunction() when the timeline completes<br />
 * 		var myTimeline:TimelineLite = new TimelineLite({onComplete:myFunction});<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//add a tween<br />
 * 		myTimeline.append(new TweenLite(mc, 1, {x:200, y:100}));<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//add another tween at the end of the timeline (makes sequencing easy)<br />
 * 		myTimeline.append(new TweenLite(mc, 0.5, {alpha:0}));<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//reverse anytime<br />
 * 		myTimeline.reverse();<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//Add a "spin" label 3-seconds into the timeline<br />
 * 		myTimeline.addLabel("spin", 3);<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//insert a rotation tween at the "spin" label (you could also define the insert point as the time instead of a label)<br />
 * 		myTimeline.insert(new TweenLite(mc, 2, {rotation:"360"}), "spin"); <br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//go to the "spin" label and play the timeline from there<br />
 * 		myTimeline.gotoAndPlay("spin");<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//add a tween to the beginning of the timeline, pushing all the other existing tweens back in time<br />
 * 		myTimeline.prepend(new TweenMax(mc, 1, {tint:0xFF0000}));<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//nest another TimelineLite inside your timeline...<br />
 * 		var nestedTimeline:TimelineLite = new TimelineLite();<br />
 * 		nestedTimeline.append(new TweenLite(mc2, 1, {x:200}));<br />
 * 		myTimeline.append(nestedTimeline);<br /><br /></code>
 * 		
 * 		
 * 	insertMultiple() and appendMultiple() provide some very powerful sequencing tools, allowing you to add an Array of 
 * 	tweens or timelines and optionally align them with SEQUENCE or START modes, and even stagger them if you want. 
 *  For example, to insert 3 tweens into the timeline, aligning their start times but staggering them by 0.2 seconds, <br /><br /><code>
 * 	
 * 		myTimeline.insertMultiple([new TweenLite(mc, 1, {y:"100"}),
 * 								   new TweenLite(mc2, 1, {x:20}),
 * 								   new TweenLite(mc3, 1, {alpha:0.5})], 
 * 								   0, 
 * 								   TweenAlign.START, 
 * 								   0.2);</code><br /><br />
 * 								   
 * 	You can use the constructor's "vars" object to do virtually all the setup too, like this sequence:<br /><br /><code>
 * 	
 * 		var myTimeline:TimelineLite = new TimelineLite({tweens:[new TweenLite(mc1, 1, {y:"100"}), TweenMax.to(mc2, 1, {tint:0xFF0000})], align:TweenAlign.SEQUENCE, onComplete:myFunction});</code><br /><br />
 * 	
 * 	If that confuses you, don't worry. Just use the <code>append(), insert()</code>, and <code>prepend()</code> methods to build your
 * 	sequence. But power users will likely appreciate the quick, compact way they can set up sequences now. <br /><br />
 *  
 * 	
 * <b>NOTES:</b>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li> TimelineLite automatically inits the OverwriteManager class to prevent unexpected overwriting behavior in sequences.
 * 	  The default mode is <code>AUTO</code>, but you can set it to whatever you want with <code>OverwriteManager.init()</code>
 * 	 (see <a href="http://www.greensock.com/overwritemanager/">http://www.greensock.com/overwritemanager/</a>)</li>
 * 	<li> TimelineLite adds about 2.6k to your SWF (3.3kb including OverwriteManager).</li>

		/**
		 * Constructor. <br /><br />
		 * 
		 * <b>SPECIAL PROPERTIES</b><br />
		 * The following special properties may be passed in via the constructor's vars parameter, like
		 * <code>new TimelineLite({paused:true, onComplete:myFunction})</code>
		 * 
		 * <ul>
		 * 	<li><b> delay : Number</b>			Amount of delay in seconds (or frames for frames-based timelines) before the timeline should begin.</li>
		 * 
		 *  <li><b> paused : Boolean</b> 		Sets the initial paused state of the timeline (by default, timelines automatically begin playing immediately)</li>
		 * 								
		 * 	<li><b> useFrames : Boolean</b>		If useFrames is set to true, the timeline's timing mode will be based on frames. 
		 * 										Otherwise, it will be based on seconds/time. NOTE: a TimelineLite's timing mode is 
		 * 										always determined by its parent timeline. </li>
		 * 
		 * 	<li><b> reversed : Boolean</b>		If true, the timeline will be reversed initially. This does NOT force it to the very end and start 
		 * 										playing backwards. It simply affects the orientation of the timeline, so if reversed is set to 
		 * 										true initially, it will appear not to play because it is already at the beginning. To cause it to
		 * 										play backwards from the end, set reversed to true and then set the <code>currentProgress</code> property to 1 immediately
		 * 										after creating the timeline.</li>
		 * 									
		 * 	<li><b> tweens : Array</b>			To immediately insert several tweens into the timeline, use the <code>tweens</code> special property
		 * 										to pass in an Array of TweenLite/TweenMax/TimelineLite/TimelineMax instances. You can use this in conjunction
		 * 										with the align and stagger special properties to set up complex sequences with minimal code.
		 * 										These values simply get passed to the insertMultiple() method.</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> align : String</b>			Only used in conjunction with the <code>tweens</code> special property when multiple tweens are
		 * 										to be inserted immediately. The value simply gets passed to the 
		 * 										<code>insertMultiple()</code> method. The default is <code>TweenAlign.NORMAL</code>. Options are:
		 * 										<ul>
		 * 											<li><b> TweenAlign.SEQUENCE:</b> aligns the tweens one-after-the-other in a sequence</li>
		 * 											<li><b> TweenAlign.START:</b> aligns the start times of all of the tweens (ignores delays)</li>
		 * 											<li><b> TweenAlign.NORMAL:</b> aligns the start times of all the tweens (honors delays)</li>
		 * 										</ul>The <code>align</code> special property does <b>not</b> force all child tweens/timelines to maintain
		 * 										relative positioning, so for example, if you use TweenAlign.SEQUENCE and then later change the duration
		 * 										of one of the nested tweens, it does <b>not</b> force all subsequent timelines to change their position
		 * 										on the timeline. The <code>align</code> special property only affects the alignment of the tweens that are
		 * 										initially placed into the timeline through the <code>tweens</code> special property of the <code>vars</code> object.</li>
		 * 										
		 * 	<li><b> stagger : Number</b>		Only used in conjunction with the <code>tweens</code> special property when multiple tweens are
		 * 										to be inserted immediately. It staggers the tweens by a set amount of time (in seconds) (or
		 * 										in frames if "useFrames" is true). For example, if the stagger value is 0.5 and the "align" 
		 * 										property is set to TweenAlign.START, the second tween will start 0.5 seconds after the first one 
		 * 										starts, then 0.5 seconds later the third one will start, etc. If the align property is 
		 * 										TweenAlign.SEQUENCE, there would be 0.5 seconds added between each tween. This value simply gets 
		 * 										passed to the insertMultiple() method. Default is 0.</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onStart : Function</b>		A function that should be called when the timeline begins (the <code>currentProgress</code> won't necessarily
		 * 										be zero when <code>onStart</code> is called. For example, if the timeline is created and then its <code>currentProgress</code>
		 * 										property is immediately set to 0.5 or if its <code>currentTime</code> property is set to something other than zero,
		 * 										<code>onStart</code> will still get fired because it is the first time the timeline is getting rendered.)</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onStartParams : Array</b>	An Array of parameters to pass the onStart function.</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onUpdate : Function</b>		A function that should be called every time the timeline's time/position is updated 
		 * 										(on every frame while the timeline is active)</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onUpdateParams : Array</b>	An Array of parameters to pass the onUpdate function</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onComplete : Function</b>	A function that should be called when the timeline has finished </li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onCompleteParams : Array</b> An Array of parameters to pass the onComplete function</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onReverseComplete : Function</b> A function that should be called when the timeline has reached its starting point again after having been reversed </li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onReverseCompleteParams : Array</b> An Array of parameters to pass the onReverseComplete functions</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> autoRemoveChildren : Boolean</b> If autoRemoveChildren is set to true, as soon as child tweens/timelines complete,
		 * 										they will automatically get killed/removed. This is normally undesireable because
		 * 										it prevents going backwards in time (like if you want to <code>reverse()</code> or set the 
		 * 										<code>currentProgress</code> value to a lower value, etc.). It can, however, improve speed and memory
		 * 										management. TweenLite's root timelines use <code>autoRemoveChildren:true</code>.</li>
		 * 	</ul>
		 * 
		 * @param vars optionally pass in special properties like <code>useFrames, onComplete, onCompleteParams, onUpdate, onUpdateParams, onStart, onStartParams, tweens, align, stagger, delay, reversed,</code> and/or <code>autoRemoveChildren</code>.
