/**
 * TweenPlugin is the base class for all TweenLite/TweenMax plugins. <br /><br />
 * 	
 * <b>USAGE:</b><br />
 * 
 * 	To create your own plugin, extend TweenPlugin and override whichever methods you need. Typically,
 * 	you only need to override onInitTween() and the changeFactor setter. I'd recommend looking at a
 *  simple plugin like FramePlugin or ScalePlugin and using it as a template of sorts. There are a few 
 *  key concepts to keep in mind:
 * 	<ol>
 * 		<li> In the constructor, set this.propName to whatever special property you want your plugin to handle. </li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> When a tween that uses your plugin initializes its tween values (normally when it starts), a new instance 
 * 		  of your plugin will be created and the onInitTween() method will be called. That's where you'll want to 
 * 		  store any initial values and prepare for the tween. onInitTween() should return a Boolean value that 
 * 		  essentially indicates whether or not the plugin initted successfully. If you return false, TweenLite/Max 
 * 		  will just use a normal tween for the value, ignoring the plugin for that particular tween.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> The changeFactor setter will be updated on every frame during the course of the tween with a multiplier
 * 		  that describes the amount of change based on how far along the tween is and the ease applied. It will be 
 * 		  zero at the beginning of the tween and 1 at the end, but inbetween it could be any value based on the 
 * 		  ease applied (for example, an Elastic.easeOut tween would cause the value to shoot past 1 and back again before 
 * 		  the end of the tween). So if the tween uses the Linear.easeNone easing equation, when it's halfway finished,
 * 		  the changeFactor will be 0.5. </li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> The overwriteProps is an Array that should contain the properties that your plugin should overwrite
 * 		  when OverwriteManager's mode is AUTO and a tween of the same object is created. For example, the 
 * 		  autoAlpha plugin controls the "visible" and "alpha" properties of an object, so if another tween 
 * 		  is created that controls the alpha of the target object, your plugin's killProps() will be called 
 * 		  which should handle killing the "alpha" part of the tween. It is your responsibility to populate
 * 		  (and depopulate) the overwriteProps Array. Failure to do so properly can cause odd overwriting behavior.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> Note that there's a "round" property that indicates whether or not values in your plugin should be
 * 		  rounded to the nearest integer (compatible with TweenMax only). If you use the _tweens Array, populating
 * 		  it through the addTween() method, rounding will happen automatically (if necessary) in the 
 * 		  updateTweens() method, but if you don't use addTween() and prefer to manually calculate tween values
 * 		  in your changeFactor setter, just remember to accommodate the "round" flag if it makes sense in your plugin.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> If you need to run a block of code when the tween has finished, point the onComplete property to a
 * 		  method you created inside your plugin.</li>
 * 
 * 		<li> If you need to run a function when the tween gets disabled, point the onDisable property to a
 * 		  method you created inside your plugin. Same for onEnable if you need to run code when a tween is
 * 		  enabled. (A tween gets disabled when it gets overwritten or finishes or when its timeline gets disabled)</li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> Please use the same naming convention as the rest of the plugins, like MySpecialPropertyNamePlugin.</li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> IMPORTANT: The plugin framework is brand new, so there is a chance that it will change slightly over time and 
 * 		  you may need to adjust your custom plugins if the framework changes. I'll try to minimize the changes,
 * 		  but I'd highly recommend getting a membership to Club GreenSock to make sure you get update notifications.
 * 		  See http://blog.greensock.com/club/ for details.</li>
