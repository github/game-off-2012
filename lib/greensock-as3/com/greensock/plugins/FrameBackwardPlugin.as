/**
 * Tweens a MovieClip backward to a particular frame number, wrapping it if/when it reaches the beginning
 * of the timeline. For example, if your MovieClip has 20 frames total and it is currently at frame 10
 * and you want tween to frame 15, a normal frame tween would go forward from 10 to 15, but a frameBackward
 * would go from 10 to 1 (the beginning) and wrap to the end and continue tweening from 20 to 15. <br /><br />
 * 
 * <b>USAGE:</b><br /><br />
 * <code>
 * 		import com.greensock.TweenLite; <br />
 * 		import com.greensock.plugins.~~; <br />
 * 		TweenPlugin.activate([FrameBackwardPlugin]); //activation is permanent in the SWF, so this line only needs to be run once.<br /><br />
 * 
 * 		TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {frameBackward:15}); <br /><br />
 * </code>
 * 
 * Note: When tweening the frames of a MovieClip, any audio that is embedded on the MovieClip's timeline (as "stream") will not be played. 
 * Doing so would be impossible because the tween might speed up or slow down the MovieClip to any degree.<br /><br />
