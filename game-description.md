# ESCAPE!  From that secret underground lab that no one is supposed to know is there.

## Premise:
You are a  scientist in a secret underground lab working for -insert corp here- when an earthquake hits!  Breaking lots of infrastructure & being generally bad!
It is only you, and Ned the Janitor, and Ned the Janitor, and Ned the Janitor, and, well, a bunch of clones of Ned the Janitor, and you must ESCAPE! while overcoming the following obstacles:

  * Roaring Fires!!!
      * Using Ned the Janitor as a fire extinguisher.
  * Perilous Chasms!!!
      * Having Ned the Janitor find objects to throw in said chasm & possibly using himself.
  * Other Dangerous Obstacles!!!
      * They are very dangerous!

## Objectives
You need to complete each level with only yourself & the cloning machine intact in order to move on to the next level.

## Equipment
You have 3 items at your disposal: a mind-controlling tuning-fork, a cloning machine, and Ned the Janitor himself.  You will need to send Ned the Janitor to collect resources, find objects, and help solve puzzles.
Unfortunately, while you can potentially create many Ned the Janitors, the tuning fork will only control so many before their Hive-Mind(tm) takes over and they start acting on their own.  Which may end up in them 
either walking off, or deciding you are a horrible master and must now die a horrible and hideous death.

### Okay, really, what is this?
This is an awesome top-down Lemming-ish RTS where you don't care about how many Lemmings make it.  In fact, the fewer Ned the Janitors who make it the better (usually) because then you are less annoyed by their 
constant mumbling about "food" and "i gotta poo" and "are we there yet?"... UGH!  how annoying!!!
