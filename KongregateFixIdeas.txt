Currently:

attack speed / movement speed 
(between 2 and 8)

damage (more is better, between 30 - 80 usually)

range 
1) either can't hit enemies, can hit some, or can hit most

hp 
2) (less than a certain amount and instantly die, eventually all towers instantly die)

hp regen 
3) (less than a certain amount and will die very fast if ever hit)

network (towers become duplicates)
upload
download


a) Once you have a great allele it effectively applies to all your towers.
b) Once you have enough slow a certain quantity of enemies are effectively stopped.
c) Fire rate is too fast for user to pay attention to individual attacks


Fixes:

1) 	- Range must be modified by very little, or modified in very small increments.
	- Range is also a factor of tower type?
2)	- Bugs need to do much less damage than towers have, a good balancing metric is that towers should not be able to last very long if they attack themselves (player does a lot of damage, but has very little HP, and bugs don't really do that much damage but have much more HP)
3)	-

Movable towers
Deletable towers

Attack speed - between 0.1 and 0.6

Raw damage (kills per second):
floor(hp/damage)*attack speed

Damage buffer window:
path in range approx = (range - 16)/32 * 4 + 1
+(path in range)*32/enemy movement speed * kills per second
